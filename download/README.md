## Google Chrome Auto Releasing by Paul Lan
With the script, you will be able to pull down latest offical builds of Google Chrome, for Windows 32, Windows 64 and macOS

## Generator of my Chrome builds downloading website
* [http://lanshunfang.github.io/xiaofang.me/download/](http://lanshunfang.github.io/xiaofang.me/download/)

## Usage
* Get a Github repo token from [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Set it in `~/.bashrc`
```shell
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=*****
```
* Set up a VM server outside China
* Fork this repo, then clone it down to the VM
* Run `main_git_release_chrome.sh` (relatively as download/main_git_release_chrome.sh)
** If you run it with `root` or `sudo -E`, it will add itself as crontab job, so that it could be automationcally run repeatly.
* Open https://github.com/:owner/xiaofang.me/releases
** Say [https://github.com/lanshunfang/xiaofang.me/releases](https://github.com/lanshunfang/xiaofang.me/releases)

## Why
* China has blocked out Chrome websites
* It might not be safe to use any builds offered by Baidu / Sina

## Note
* My [Chrome releases](https://github.com/lanshunfang/xiaofang.me/releases) are generated by the script and safe to use if you don't want more bothering setting up your own server outside China
* You could use `index.html` (relatively as download/index.html) in your own web server or just setup a github.io to read it
* Say [http://lanshunfang.github.io/xiaofang.me/download/](http://lanshunfang.github.io/xiaofang.me/download/)
